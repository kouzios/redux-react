# Redux React Learning Project

This is a simple project with decriments and incriments on an integer to learn how redux works.

I followed the lead of two sites during this process:
- [React Redux - Basic Tutorial](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial)
- [Egg Head - Counter Example](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-react-counter-example)
